    <h1>Happy Birthday, Mridu ❤️</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Today is the day the world became more beautiful, because you were born. And I'm grateful I get to celebrate you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>For the Most Beautiful Girl</h2>
    <p>
      Mridu, you deserve a day as bright as your smile and as warm as your heart.
      You're the kind of person who makes the world softer, kinder, and more magical just by being in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      May this year bring you endless happiness, unexpected blessings, and every little joy your heart has ever wished for. You deserve all of it and more.
    </p>
    <p class="pickup-line">
      "If beauty were a time, you'd be eternity."
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Your Smile, My Sunrise</h2>
    <p>
      Every time you smile, the whole world feels lighter. You have this soft magic in you,
      Mridu—something that makes even ordinary days feel special. I don’t know how you do it,
      but I hope you never stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re not just beautiful. You’re comforting. You’re inspiring. You’re unforgettable.
      And today, the universe is celebrating you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Wishes for Your Year Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      I hope this year brings you everything your heart quietly dreams of—
      moments that make you feel alive, laughter that stays with you,
      and peace that feels like home.
    </p>
    <p>
      May you shine brighter than ever, chase your dreams fearlessly,
      and never forget how truly special you are.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>A Little More, Just for You</h2>
    <p>
      If I could write the sky with colors, I would paint your name in the stars.
      If I could borrow the wind, I’d send it to whisper how wonderful you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if I could freeze a moment, it would be any moment where you are smiling.
    </p>
    <div class="pickup-line">
      "I must be a snowflake, because I've fallen for you—and trust me, I don't melt easily."
